1. When I'm on my Station#show page, when I click on the name of a show, I want
   to be taken to the Show#show page. I want to see the show's details, and I also
   want to see my status details of the show. From here, I want an edit button
   that will let me edit the status details for just this show on just this station.

2. When I'm on my Stations#show page, I want a button next to each show that will
   let me remove the show from that station only.

3. When I'm on the Shows#show page, I want to see the details about the show. I also
   want to see my Stations the show is in and the status details of each station.
   From here, I want an edit button that will let me edit the status details for just
   this show on just this station.

4. On the Shows#show page, if a show is not in any of my stations, I want a button
   that will take me to the StationShow#new page and it will let me add the show
   to a station.
