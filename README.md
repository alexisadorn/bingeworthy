 The application helps you keep track of your favorite and must-watch TV shows, and create lists to manage and organize those shows. This is a portfolio project for the Rails section of the Flatiron School's Web Development Immersive program.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Then run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

To learn more about how to sign up, log in, create watchlists and add shows, see my video walkthrough here.

If you have questions about the code, please take a look at my blog post on the process.
